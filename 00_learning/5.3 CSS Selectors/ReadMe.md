# Notes: 

* Element selector h1 {color:red}
* h1 is the header html CSS element selector
* You can use the attribute class to use class selectors in css
* Class selector .class-name {color:red} and <h1 class="class-name">, two different class types can share the same class attribute value
* Id selector #id-name {color:red} and <h1 id="id-name">, id can be used in a single element in all the file
* Attribute selector <p draggable="true"> if you use p[draggable] {color:red} then css will take all elements 'p' with the attribute draggable defined
* if you use p[draggable="something"] {color:red} then css will take all elements 'p' with the attribute draggable equal to "something"
* Universal selector * {color:red} will take all elements and format them
