* font-size: 20px, how big a pixel is?, relative actually
* px means pixel, pt means point about 1/72nd inches similar to word font sizes
* em means the lenght of a letter 'm', the longest letter in alphabet, it is a relative size to the parent size
* rem means root html size relative
* Difference is that rem is more consistend cause is relative to root and not parent as em
* Both em and rem are times the relative size
* em and rem are non-static sizes
* font-weight: bold, can use lighter and bolder to increase size relative to parent
