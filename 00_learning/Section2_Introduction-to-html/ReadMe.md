# Notes: 

* You can go to https://web.dev/ from https://developer.google.org/ to learn more about html, css and js
* <p></p>
* Yo can get text for web test non-productive here www.lipsum.com
* Void elements <hr /> "Horizontal" and <br /> "Break"
* Use break elements just when you actually want to have a single paragraph
* You can remove the '/' in each element, but it is easier to read with it
